# Introduction to Solar Jets 
Solar jets are narrow ejections of plasma in the solar atmosphere, which arise from a sudden energy release and mass eruption in the solar atmosphere via the reconfiguration of the magnetic field lines at the jet base (Figure 1). Solar jets are major factors that contribute to the mass and energy input in the upper solar atmosphere and solar wind. The atmospheric image taken from the Sun can be divided into active regions mainly caused by solar jets and quiet areas without them (Tsiropoula et al., 2012).
