# Introduction to Solar Jets 
Solar jets are narrow ejections of plasma in the solar atmosphere (Figure 1), which arise from a sudden energy release and mass eruption in the solar atmosphere via the reconfiguration of the magnetic field lines at the jet base (Figure 2). Solar jets are major factors that contribute to the mass and energy input in the upper solar atmosphere and solar wind. The atmospheric image taken from the Sun can be divided into active regions mainly caused by solar jets and quiet areas without them (Tsiropoula et al., 2012).

# Research Question and Objective
The objective of this study is to investigate the atmospheric activity of the Sun via solar jet observations from the Earth. Solar jet energy outputs are mainly measured from their X-ray radiation intensities based on the constitution of solar jets (Friedman, 1963). The project aims to reveal the atmospheric solar activity on the side of the Sun facing Earth via the image analysis of solar jets for a specified time period. To support the study, it is shown that the atmospheric solar activity corresponds with the variation of X- ray intensity measured from the same side of the Sun within the same time period.
